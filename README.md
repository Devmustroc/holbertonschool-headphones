Implementing a design from scratch, based on some design models given on [Figma](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/y6_o1T-HtCyTAGuOJqdA_g).

### Concepts

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
## Requirements

- you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use Javascript

**0. Read and be familiar with Figma**

Create an account in Figma and open this project and Duplicate to your Drafts to have access to all design details.

If you can't access to it, please find here the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/gkWRcFqkwtruWZgSfnnHF0/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?node-id=0%3A2)

**1. Header**

Files: [0-index.html](0-index.html/) - [0-styles.css](0-styles.css/)

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple as generic as you can CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece
